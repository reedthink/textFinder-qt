"When thou art with me, the other hours
Are black and bitter. But the moment that I see thee,
My head is filled with Day, and all the stars
Of Night are in my eyes; and there thou sit'st,
The one perfect thing in all my world;
A world that's otherwise but a sterile promontory,
A bare beach-front, whereon the tide doth daily break,
And wash the footprints of time away.
Yea, thou art every thing, as every thing thus doth commend thee;
And I am nothing, without thee, dearest, thou art every thing in me."

This extract is from Act 1, Scene 2 of "Hamlet", where Horatio praises Hamlet's worth and beauty, comparing him to the sun that brings light and warmth to the world.
